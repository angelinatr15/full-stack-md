to create a detail page that once clicked it will send you to a page of it's own you must:

=> create a file in page. 

=> in that file create an [id].js and index.js file. 
    (be sure to rafce both files and import pool so that you can use it)
    (dont forget to use getStatisProps for both id and index and getStaticPaths for id)

=> create a component page. In the component folder create a parent and child file. 
    (dont forget to router.push that child)

=> work on the backend in the api folder. Create 2 files one will be [id].js and index.js. For this purpose will be only be utilizing [id].js but make both to save time in the future. 
    (be sure to import pool. Work on back end function to intereact with front end)
